\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

First and foremost, I extend my deepest and most sincere gratitude to my supervisor, Dr. Sato Reiko. She is the one who first introduced me to research, and her mentorship, patience, and guidance have been foundational to my academic journey.



I am deeply grateful to my committee members for their patience and the countless hours of invaluable guidance they provided on the research and editing of this dissertation.

I also wish to thank my lab members: Kato Seiya, Shan Kai, and Gao Kevin. Their support, encouragement, and camaraderie meant a great deal to me, and I wish them all the best in their own research endeavors.

Finally, I must thank all the participants who generously volunteered their time for my experiments. This research would not have been possible without their participation and the valuable data they provided.
