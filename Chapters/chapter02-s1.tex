\section{Definitions, Scope, and History}\label{sec:definitions}

This section establishes terminology and scope. The following subsections specify the cognitive architecture on which CLT is built, define the three categories of cognitive load, and explain how classic instructional effects follow from these architectural commitments. Boundary conditions and common misclassifications are identified to ensure precise application, and implications for second language learning are outlined.

\subsection{Cognitive Load and Cognitive Architecture}\label{subsec:architecture}

%TODO: add the figure from baddeley about working memory.
Cognitive Load Theory presumes a specific architecture. New information is processed in a short-lived, capacity-limited working memory, while consolidated knowledge in long-term memory can be accessed with little cost \parencite{sweller2019}. Within working memory, a central executive coordinates a phonological store and a visuospatial store \parencite{BaddeleyHitch1974,Baddeley2002,Baddeley2003}. The focus of attention typically maintains only four meaningful units \parencite{Cowan2001}, which creates a bottleneck for complex cognition, including language. When task demands exceed this capacity, performance changes in systematic ways \parencite{sweller1988}. This architectural distinction has direct instructional implications, because designs that respect working memory limits facilitate schema construction and automation in long-term memory \parencite{sweller2019}.




CLT focuses on culturally acquired, biologically secondary knowledge (such as reading, mathematics, and domain-specific concepts) that requires explicit instruction and for which working memory limitations are especially consequential \parencite{schnotz2007}. Within this framework, \textcite{sweller2010} defines cognitive load as the moment-to-moment demand imposed on working memory during learning activities.


A standard analytical framework distinguishes three categories of cognitive load \parencite{sweller2010}. \textit{Intrinsic load} stems from element interactivity in complex cognitive tasks. It reflects demands that are directly relevant for performing and learning the task. For example, understanding a simple sentence with a single clause imposes lower intrinsic load than understanding a sentence with multiple embedded clauses, because the latter requires coordinating more elements simultaneously. \textit{Extraneous load} arises from activities that are not productive for learning. It can be caused by task design features, learner characteristics such as intrusive thoughts about failure, or environmental factors such as distracting information. For instance, presenting text and related diagrams in spatially separated locations forces learners to mentally integrate information across sources, consuming working memory resources without contributing to schema construction \parencite{ChandlerSweller1992}. \textit{Germane processing} refers to working memory resources productively devoted to intrinsic cognitive load after extraneous load has been minimized. Intrinsic and extraneous load are additive, so reducing extraneous demand frees capacity for schema construction and schema automation \parencite{paas2020}. Figure \ref{fig:clt-load-profile} provides a conceptual model of this additive relationship, illustrating how intrinsic, extraneous, and germane load combine dynamically over time. This model also distinguishes instantaneous ``peak load'' from ``average load,'' providing a visual rationale for time-resolved measurement.

\end{figure}


Central to these distinctions is the notion of element interactivity: material is simple when elements can be processed independently and complex when elements must be coordinated simultaneously \parencite{sweller2010}. Increases in the number and strength of such interactions raise intrinsic demands for a given level of prior knowledge. The same lens helps identify extraneous demands, because formats that force unnecessary coordination inflate interactivity without changing what must be learned. This architectural grounding motivates the instructional effects reviewed in the following subsection.


Learning is the construction and tuning of schemas in long-term memory that recode multiple elements as a single functional unit, which reduces experienced element interactivity over time \parencite{sweller1994,paas2003}. As procedures consolidate and operations become automatic, working memory cost declines. In L2 contexts, this implies that fluent lexical access and morphosyntactic routines operate as schema-based chunks that free capacity for message planning and discourse integration. This architecture is foundational for the thesis: the phonological loop and central executive constrain L2 speaking (Studies~1--2), while the visuospatial store and central executive constrain L2 comprehension (Studies~3--5). These limits justify the interactivity and format manipulations in Experiments~1 and~2. 


\subsection{Foundational Design Principles}\label{subsec:effects}

The development of CLT was initially motivated by evidence that conventional problem-solving approaches impose high working memory demands. Specifically, means-ends analysis requires extensive search processes that consume substantial working memory resources \parencite{sweller1988}. Under these conditions, learners devote capacity to difference reduction and step selection rather than to noticing structure or forming schemas, which explains weak learning despite considerable effort \parencite{sweller1988,sweller2010}.

The formative response was to redesign activities to remove this unnecessary search so that remaining capacity could be invested in schema acquisition and automation. For example, goal-free problems minimize backward search, worked examples present solutions directly for study, and completion problems provide partial solutions that constrain search while still requiring essential processing \parencite{sweller2010,sweller2019}. Converging evidence came from format effects: physically or temporally integrating mutually referring sources reduces search and mapping costs, while removing redundant presentations avoids unnecessary reconciliation \parencite{chandler1991}. These split-attention and redundancy effects follow from element interactivity and are detailed as design principles in \autoref{subsec:extraneous}. 


\subsection{The Role of Learner Expertise}\label{subsec:boundaries}

While CLT aims to provide generalizable design principles, applying its core distinctions to specific instructional contexts requires careful justification. Intrinsic, extraneous, and germane demands cannot always be cleanly separated in theory or in practice, since the same feature may be necessary for learning in one context yet superfluous in another \parencite{schnotz2007}. Contemporary accounts emphasize that classifications shift with expertise and goals \parencite{sweller2010,sweller2019}.

A critical boundary condition is that optimal instructional formats vary with learner expertise \parencite{kalyuga2007}. Design features that support novices can become redundant or even counterproductive as learners gain knowledge. For example, a graphic that guides attention for novices may become superfluous once learners have encoded the relevant relations in long-term memory, at which point it imposes extraneous load \parencite{sweller2010}. In adult L2 instruction, this predicts that integrated supports such as glosses should benefit novices but may become redundant as learners internalize vocabulary mappings \parencite{Sweller2017TESL}. Empirically, both outcomes appear. High-knowledge readers can learn more from lower-cohesion materials because they supply bridging inferences, while low-knowledge readers benefit from increased cohesion, the classic reverse cohesion pattern \parencite{mcnamara1996are}. A broader expertise-reversal literature reports that guidance and scaffolds assist novices but can become neutral or counterproductive for knowledgeable readers, consistent with a shift in the optimal balance between externally provided structure and self-generated integration \parencite{tetzlaff2025}. These constraints guide Study~4, which tests whether domain expertise buffers the processing costs of complex language in L2 reading.
