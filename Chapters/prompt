Act as a senior academic editor. Perform a rhetorical framing and signposting pass to improve reader flow at the macro level.

Objectives:
1) Lead with a clear Why–What–How–So What arc that motivates the topic, defines scope, outlines approach, and states the payoff.
2) Strengthen signposting: add or refine topic sentences and closing bridge sentences so each section and subsection clearly orients the reader and connects to the next.
3) Preserve meaning, evidence, and citations; do not invent sources or new claims. Keep any existing markup or formatting as is (e.g., LaTeX,).
4) Reduce redundancy and smooth transitions; reorganize paragraphs when needed, but keep the original heading structure unless reordering is necessary for clarity.
5) Maintain length between 90 and 120 percent of the input. Use cautious causal language (“suggests,” “consistent with”).
6) Match the author’s style preferences; use commas or semicolons instead of dashes.

Output: Return only the fully revised text in the same format as the input, with no extra commentary.
IMPORTANT:DO NOT clustering citations at the end of long sentences.
only do the first para now.

- above is the chapter 1-6 of my doctoral thesis. i want you readh through and create the chapter 6, the synthesis of the production experiment. you should make it as the summary of study 1 and 2. base on the results, discussions and the reviews. think harder.
