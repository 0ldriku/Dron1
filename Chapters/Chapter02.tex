\chapter{Cognitive Load: Architecture and Applications}\label{ch:cogload}


This chapter establishes the theoretical foundations of Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) and reviews empirical evidence for its application to second language learning. \autoref{sec:definitions} defines cognitive load within a specific model of human cognitive architecture. It distinguishes intrinsic, extraneous, and germane load, and traces how these distinctions generate classic instructional effects. \autoref{sec:consequences} examines behavioral signatures of cognitive load in L2 production and comprehension, connecting theoretical constructs to observable patterns in speech and reading. \autoref{sec:manipulations} reviews design principles for managing intrinsic demands, reducing extraneous demands, and fostering productive processing. \autoref{sec:verification} specifies the methodological approach to validating cognitive load manipulations, including subjective ratings, behavioral indices, and physiological measures. \autoref{sec:load-selfeff} examines the bidirectional relationship between cognitive load and self-efficacy, a motivational construct that shapes how learners allocate effort and interpret difficulty.
